# Mini-Shell
Developed a lightweight Unix shell in C with support for built-in commands (cd, pwd), process management using fork(), and environment variables. Implemented command execution, including piping (|), sequential (;), parallel (&), and conditional execution (&&, ||). Added I/O redirection for standard input/output and error streams. Ensured proper operator precedence and efficient command parsing, gaining hands-on experience with system calls, file descriptors, and process synchronization.
