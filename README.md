# Mini-Shell
Developed a lightweight Unix shell in C with support for built-in commands, process management and environment variables. 
Implemented command execution, including piping, sequential, parallel, and conditional execution. Added I/O redirection for standard input/output and error streams.

Ensured proper operator precedence and efficient command parsing, gaining hands-on experience with system calls, file descriptors, and process synchronization.
